3. **Logistics Transportation** - Calculate carbon emissions in transportation
4. **Product Usage** - Assess energy consumption during usage phase
5. **Recycling Processing** - Measure environmental impact of recycling and reuse
6. **Natural Decomposition** - Analyze carbon emissions from final product disposal

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Configure AI API Key

This system uses AI for intelligent analysis and requires API Key configuration:

1. **Copy configuration file**
```bash
cp config.example.js config.js
```

2. **Get API Key**

**Option 1: Use Alibaba Cloud DashScope (Recommended)**
- Visit [Alibaba Cloud DashScope Console](https://dashscope.console.aliyun.com/)
- Login and create API Key
- Supports DeepSeek, Qwen and other models
- Free quota for new users

**Option 2: Use OpenAI**
- Visit [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- Create API Key
- Also need to modify `AI_CONFIG.baseUrl` and `model` in `script.js`

3. **Configure API Key**

Edit `config.js` file, replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API Key:

```javascript
window.AI_API_KEY = 'sk-your-actual-api-key-here';
```

**Important Notes:**
- `config.js` file is added to `.gitignore` and will not be committed to Git repository
- Do not share your real API Key with others or commit to public repositories
- If API Key is not configured, the system will use mock data for demonstration

### Step 2: Open Application

**No installation required!** Open directly in browser:

1. **Download or clone this project**
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <project-folder>
```

2. **Open application**
   - Find `index_improved.html` file in project folder
   - Double-click to open, or right-click and select "Open with" → Choose browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari, etc.)
   - System will run automatically in browser

3. **Start using**
   - Upload product design documents
   - View AI analysis results
   - Manage carbon emission optimization tasks

That's it!

### Advanced: Local Server Mode (Optional)

For better performance and extended features, use Node.js to run local server:

**Requirements:** Node.js >= 18

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Start server
npm start

# 3. Access application
# http://localhost:3000
```

**Development mode (auto-restart):**
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Usage Guide

### Complete Workflow

#### Step 1: Upload Product Design Document

In "Document Upload" module:

1. **Upload file**
   - Click upload area or drag file directly to page
   - Supported formats: PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT
   - System immediately starts parsing document content

2. **AI auto-analysis**
   - AI assistant automatically analyzes document content
   - Extracts product design key information
   - Displays analysis progress and result summary

3. **Intelligent information completion**
   - AI identifies missing key information
   - Click "Start Auto Complete" button
   - AI intelligently infers and fills based on document content:
     - Product material type and weight
     - Production process and energy consumption data
     - Transportation mode and distance
     - Expected service life
     - Recycling treatment method, etc.

4. **Start carbon emission analysis**
   - After information completion, "Start Analysis" button activates
   - Click button to start complete carbon emission calculation
   - System automatically switches to Kanban analysis module

#### Step 2: View Carbon Emission Analysis

Switch to "Kanban Analysis" module:

1. **Reverse timeline display**
   - Displays in reverse order from product lifecycle end (natural decomposition) to start (raw material procurement)
   - Six stages:
     - Natural Decomposition
